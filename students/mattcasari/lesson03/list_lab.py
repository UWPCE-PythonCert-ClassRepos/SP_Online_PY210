Tasks:
    Series 1:
        - Create a list that contains “Apples”, “Pears”, “Oranges” and “Peaches”.
        - Display the list (plain old print() is fine…).
        - Ask the user for another fruit and add it to the end of the list.
        - Display the list.
        - Ask the user for a number and display the number back to the user and the fruit corresponding to that number (on a 1-is-first basis). Remember that Python uses zero-based indexing, so you will need to correct.
        - Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using “+” and display the list.
        - Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using insert() and disp

    Series 2:
        Using the list created in series 1 above:
        - Display the list.
        - Remove the last fruit from the list.
        - Display the list.
        - Ask the user for a fruit to delete, find it and delete it.
        - (Bonus: Multiply the list times two. Keep asking until a match is found. Once found, delete all occurrences.)
    
    Series 3:
        Again, using the list from series 1:
        - Ask the user for input displaying a line like “Do you like apples?” for each fruit in the list (making the fruit all lowercase).
        - For each “no”, delete that fruit from the list.
        - For any answer that is not “yes” or “no”, prompt the user to answer with one of those two values (a while loop is good here)
        - Display the list

    Series 4:
        Once more, using the list from series 1:
        - Make a new list with the contents of the original, but with all the letters in each item reversed.
        - Delete the last item of the original list. Display the original list and the copy.
