CodingBat Problem-
Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.


front3('Java') → 'JavJavJav'
front3('Chocolate') → 'ChoChoCho'
front3('abc') → 'abcabcabc'

def front3(str):
  if len(str)<3:
    front = str
  else:
    front = str[0:3]
  return front*3
