# Welcome, Students!

When you join the course, please do the following:

1. Create a directory named after you. This is a public repository, so if you want to remain anonymous, you don't need to use your full name.
 - It can be your first name
 - It can be your gitHub handle
 - It can be an arbitrary nickname -- just make sure to let your instructor know

2. Create a README for your directory.
  * Feel free to personalize it a bit!
  * Share some things about what makes you you.
  * Tell us what you want to get out of this course.
  * Protip: Never make a project without a README. What if Two-Years-Older-*You*
    forgets what the project was about?
